%%% cleanup and remove bad nodes' timeseries (whichever is not listed in ts.DD is *BAD*).

%%% create various kinds of network matrices and optionally convert correlations to z-stats.
%%% here's various examples - you might only generate/use one of these.

%%% the r2z transformation estimates an empirical correction for autocorrelation in the data.

%%% view of consistency of netmats across subjects; returns t-test Z values as a network matrix
%%% second argument (0 or 1) determines whether to display the Z matrix and a consistency scatter plot
%%% third argument (optional) groups runs together; e.g. setting this to 4 means each group of 4 runs were from the same subject
Znet3=nets_consistency(netmat3,1);   % test whichever netmat you're interested in; returns Z values from one-group t-test


%%% view hierarchical clustering of nodes

meanPCORR=reshape(mean(netmat3),ts.Nnodes,ts.Nnodes);    % average the partial corr netmat across subjects, and reshape
%%% now make the figure; arg1 is shown below the diagonal (and drives the clustering/hierarchy); arg2 is shown above diagonal

%%% cross-subject GLM, with inference in randomise (assuming you already have the GLM design.mat and design.con files).
%%% arg4 determines whether to view the corrected-p-values, with non-significant entries removed above the diagonal.
[p_uncorrected,p_corrected]=nets_glm(netmat1,'design.mat','design.con',1);  % returns matrices of 1-p
%%% OR - GLM, but with pre-masking that tests only the connections that are strong on average across all subjects.
%%% change the "8" to a different tstat threshold to make this sparser or less sparse.
%netmat=netmat3;  [grotH,grotP,grotCI,grotSTATS]=ttest(netmat);  netmat(:,abs(grotSTATS.tstat)<8)=0;
%[p_uncorrected,p_corrected]=nets_glm(netmat,'design.mat','design.con',1);


%%% simple cross-subject multivariate discriminant analyses, for just two-group cases.
%%% arg1 is whichever netmat you want to test.
%%% arg2 is the size of first group of subjects; set to 0 if you have two groups with paired subjects.
%%% outputs are: FLD, FLDmean(no covar), T, Tmax, Tthresh4, T/std, linear-SVM
[lda_percentages]=nets_lda(netmat3,36)


%%% create boxplots for the two groups for a network-matrix-element of interest (e.g., selected from GLM output)
%%% arg3 = matrix row number,    i.e. the first  component of interest (from the DD list)
%%% arg4 = matrix column number, i.e. the second component of interest (from the DD list)
%%% arg5 = size of the first group (set to -1 for paired groups)
